## 📝 Overview

BackgroundRemover streamlines background removal from images using **deep learning**. Designed for:

- Graphic designers
- Photographers
- Content creators
- Small businesses

**Key benefits:**

- Removes backgrounds in under a second
- No design or technical skills required
- API-based access for integration

---

## ⚠️ Problem

Manual background removal is time-consuming, costly, and often requires advanced software. Existing tools are either:

- Expensive
- Complex
- Require manual intervention

This creates a barrier for small creators, entrepreneurs, and photographers who need fast, precise results.

---

## 💡 Solution

BackgroundRemover leverages **U-Net-based convolutional neural networks** for accurate object-background separation. Users send images to an **API endpoint** and receive processed images instantly.

**Key features:**

- High precision background removal
- Cloud-based API for accessibility
- Fast processing (<1 second per image)

## 🛠️ Process

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Gathered large dataset of annotated images
- Applied augmentation (rotation, scaling)

### 2️⃣ Model Architecture
- **U-Net** for semantic segmentation
- Encoder-decoder structure with skip connections

### 3️⃣ Model Training
- Training using SGD and binary cross-entropy
- Batch normalization and dropout for generalization

### 4️⃣ Post-processing & Refinement
- Morphological operations (dilation, erosion)
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance

### 5️⃣ API Deployment
- Docker-based cloud deployment
- RESTful API for image submission and return
